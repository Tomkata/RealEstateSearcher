RealEstateSearcher

A minimal web-application built in C#, targeting the real-estate domain: search, filter and browse properties via a clean architecture.
It pulls apartment data from imot.bg and lets you browse and search through them in a simple web interface.

1. Project Overview

RealEstateSearcher is designed to give you a scaffold for a real-estate listing/search service. It handles core concerns (data model, services, infrastructure) so you can focus on adding domain features or customizing UI.
